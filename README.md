# CorrelationPowerAnalysis
Implementation of a side-channel attack using Correlation Power Analysis with Python 

- How to execute the the program:
1. Ensure that the demo waveform file (waveform374samples_327_2047.csv) and the executable file (Main.exe) are in the same directory.

2. Double click the "Main.exe" executable.

3. A terminal will pop up. Please do give it some time to load all the libraries at the back end. It should take around 15 seconds.

4. A user interface will be shown as below:

    
5. The program will now ask for the name of the CSV file that contain the traces. Users may choose to analysis their own set of traces by placing the their own trace file in the same directory as the executable file and provide the name of their own waveform files. However, for this demo, please press enter to proceed with the demo waveform file as that file contains the traces collected during the lab experiment.

6. Users may also indicate the start of the index of their own waveform files. However, for this demo, please press enter to proceed with the default setting.

7. Users may also indicate the end of the index of their own waveform files. However, for this demo, please press enter to proceed with the default setting.

8. Users may also indicate the maximum number of traces to be used for analysis in their own waveform files. However, for this demo, please press enter to proceed with the default setting.
