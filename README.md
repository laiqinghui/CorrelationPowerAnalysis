# CorrelationPowerAnalysis
Implementation of a side-channel attack using Correlation Power Analysis with Python 

- How to execute the the program:
1. Ensure that the demo waveform file (waveform374samples_327_2047.csv) and the executable file (Main.exe) are in the same directory.
2. Double click the "Main.exe" executable.
3. A terminal will pop up. Please do give it some time to load all the libraries at the back end. It should take less than a minute.
4. A user interface will be shown as below:

5. Users may indicate the name of their own waveform files. However, for this demo, please press enter to proceed with the demo waveform file as that file contains the traces collected during lab 1 and 2 by the students.
6. Users may also indicate the start of the index of their own waveform files. However, for this demo, please press enter to proceed with the default setting.
7. Users may also indicate the end of the index of their own waveform files. However, for this demo, please press enter to proceed with the default setting.
8. Users may also indicate the maximum number of traces to be used for analysis in their own waveform files. However, for this demo, please press enter to proceed with the default setting.
